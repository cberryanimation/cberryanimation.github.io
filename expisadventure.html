		<p>Expi's Adventure is a ROM hack of Super Mario World I am currently working on. It is based off of my "The Two Cats" series, and as the title suggests stars Expi, on her adventure to rescue Mariko. The hack is still very early in development, and I'm not entirely sure I will even finish it (ultimately comes down to how much I'd prefer to put time towards other projects), but if work continues, I hope to have it out by the end of 2021 or 2022. My plans are to create about 8 different worlds with my own levels, and in addition overhaul the entire level design to fit the "The Two Cats" theme.</p>
	    <p>I have created a demo for the game that is subject to further development. Due to legal concerns, I can not supply the ROM, however you can download a BPS file which you can apply to your own Super Mario World ROM <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XIZpxMs4JUR5whRsb4ky0M7APocRygx8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. For any help, look up how to apply a BPS patch on Google. Keep in mind that this is still very early in development, so many assets and levels won't appear the same as they may in the final hack if finished.</p>
