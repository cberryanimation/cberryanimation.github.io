	<h1>Cole Berry's Portfolio</h1>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Cole Berry, and I have created this website from scratch (via HTML and CSS code) to serve as my portfolio.</p>
			<p>Above you will find my demo reel, containing some art pieces as well as spliced footage from previous animations I have done.</p>
			<p>I am currently going to college for an Associate's Degree in Animation and certificate in Web Design. I have a lot of experience with character design as seen in a lot of my animation and art work. I enjoy creating characters and writing stories about them.</p>
	
			<p>To see animations and art that I have worked or am working on, click on the respective tabs in the header above. I hope you enjoy my work!</p>
