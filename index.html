			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Cole Berry, and I have created this website from scratch (via HTML and CSS code) to serve as my portfolio.</p>
			<p>Above is one of my animations, and you can see others that I have created in the Animations tab above. You can also view my Art and other Web Pages that I have created by clicking on their respective tabs.</p>
			<p>I have recently obtained my Associate's Degree in 'Graphic Design - Animation' at Aims Community College, and I also hold a certificate in Web Design.</p>
	
			<p>To see animations and art that I have worked or am working on, click on the respective tabs in the header above. I hope you enjoy my work!</p>
